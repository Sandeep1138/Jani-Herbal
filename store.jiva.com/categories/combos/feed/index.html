This oil, a combination of effective classical formulas, releases muscular and nervous tension and ensures proper blood circulation that helps ease joint pains and stiffness.<br />
<strong>Massage Oil :</strong> It is a blend of selected revitalizing herbs that are processed in the oil to nourish the muscles and the skin. Regular massaging enhances blood circulation, cleanses impurities and makes the skin glow. It also smooths the skin, clears wrinkles and cures sagging skin, giving a fresh and radiant look.</p>
<p><strong>Indication</strong></p>
