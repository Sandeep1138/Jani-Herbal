								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jiva Pachak Vati reduces aggravated Tridoshas (Vata, Pitta &amp; Kapha) and helps digestion by increasing peristaltic movement. This special formulation of trusted natural ingredients, which quickly control acidity, flatulence and indigestion is a good remedy for digestive disorders. We have chosen quality herbal ingredients from organic environs and employed processes that are primed to give you a balanced product without contamination or loss of potency. This is a pure herbal product with no additives.</p>
<h2><strong>Action</strong></h2>
<p>Jiva Pachak Vati contains equal quantities of pippali and marich for reducing Kapha and Vata aggravation. It also helps in deworming children or adults. Marich or pepper has a stimulating effect on the digestive organs and produces an increased flow of saliva and gastric juices.

Anar seeds provides relief in Tridosha aggravation and brings down hyperacidity, while lavang is very effective in assisting your digestive system to absorb nutrients.</p>
