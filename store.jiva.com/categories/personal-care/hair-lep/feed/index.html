								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jiva Hair Lep is an Ayurvedic powder that has been specifically designed keeping dry and oily hair in mind. Tough on grease and grime that tend to collect in the scalp, the pack cleans the scalp without stripping it of moisture, like normal shampoos. The Hair Lep strengthens the roots of the hair, stops hair-fall, and provides natural nourishment to brittle hair.</p>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Indication</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">This Hair Lep can be used by anyone who is suffering from dry, brittle or oily hair, but it’s just as beneficial to people with normal hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Action</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">Amla provides great nourishment to the dry scalp. Neem extract helps fight the salts and artificial minerals that get deposited in the hair. Til and Harar are helpful in strengthening brittle and lifeless hair. Multani mitti absorbs excess oil from hair and scalp</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Contraindications</h2>
