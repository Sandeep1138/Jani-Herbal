								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cleansing ear with ear candles is an ancient technique. The warmth and low suction force created by burning of the candle draws dirt, debris and wax inside the candle to provide relaxation and relief. The ear candles are made of beeswax and 100% cotton muslin. On burning, it generates warm smoke which melts ear wax and a low suction force. This action cleans the ear of excess wax and dirt, which removes irritation and discomfort in the ear. The candle tips are coated in beeswax to ensure comfortable fit in the ear.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dhyan Chakshu is a simple and natural way to treat vision related problems. Dhyan Chakshu is designed according to the &#8216;Ayurvedic Tratak principle&#8217; which trains and strengthens eye muscles. By limiting the peripheral vision, Dhyan Chakshu trains the eye muscles, improves blood supply, and increases the degree of accommodation. Daily use of at least 30 minutes help in improving clarity of vision, naturally. Jiva Dhyan Chakshu does not have a prescription lens in it, which makes it perfect for everybody. Professionals who work on computer screens, or use mobile screens for long periods of time benefit from the added advantage of protection against glare and screen fatigue.</p>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Indication</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">Dhyan Chakshu isn’t just for people with weak vision, it can also be used by people with perfect vision, so that they can exercise their eyes and keep them healthy for life.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Action</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">Dhyan Chakshu covers the eyes completely, allowing light to filter in through these minute lenses. This forces the eyes to concentrate, thereby exercising and stimulating them.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Contraindications</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">Do not wear Dhyan Chakshu for any activity that needs you to use peripheral vision, like driving, walking on street or working with machines, tools and other kinds of equipment.</p>
