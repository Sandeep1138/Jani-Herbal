								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dhyan Chakshu is a simple and natural way to treat vision related problems. Dhyan Chakshu is designed according to the &#8216;Ayurvedic Tratak principle&#8217; which trains and strengthens eye muscles.

Daily use of at least 30 minutes help in improving clarity of vision, naturally. Jiva Dhyan Chakshu does not have a prescription lens in it, which makes it perfect for everybody. Professionals who work on computer screens, or use mobile screens for long periods of time benefit from the added advantage of protection against glare and screen fatigue.</p>
