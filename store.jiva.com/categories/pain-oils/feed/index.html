								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pain Calm Oil:</strong> The oil works wonders in patients whose body movements are impaired, or whose major or minor joints are affected. It melts away ‘ama’ (toxin) deposits from the joints – the toxins that cause redness and swelling in the affected areas. This oil, a combination of effective classical formulas, releases muscular and nervous tension and ensures proper blood circulation that helps ease joint pains and stiffness.<br />
<strong>Massage Oil :</strong> It is a blend of selected revitalizing herbs that are processed in the oil to nourish the muscles and the skin. Regular massaging enhances blood circulation, cleanses impurities and makes the skin glow. It also smooths the skin, clears wrinkles and cures sagging skin, giving a fresh and radiant look.</p>
<p><strong>Indication</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain Calm Oil:</strong> This oil is excellent for pain relief in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, gout, cervical and joint pains, stiffness and backaches, frozen shoulders, sciatica and muscular sprains.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medicated Til Oil is extremely beneficial in relieving pain and stiffness of joints, as well as providing strength to the muscles. It works on pacifying the Vata Dosha (Ayurvedic humor representing Air), which, when aggravated, leads to blocking of channels in the body. It can also be used for body massage, as well as in cooking. Massage with Til Oil is known to give luster to the skin and give relief from tremors in the hands and feet.</p>
