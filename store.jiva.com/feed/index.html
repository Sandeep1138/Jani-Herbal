								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the diseases that women are susceptible to during menopause is Osteoporosis. It is the weakening of the bones due to a reduction of bone density. This disease makes your bones weaker and more susceptible to fractures, which can prove to be fatal in old age.</p>
<h2>Causes of Menopausal Osteoporosis</h2>
<ul>
<li>The main cause is declining levels of estrogen.</li>
<li>People with a vata body type are more prone to it.</li>
<li>A sedentary lifestyle.</li>
<li>Drinking too much alcohol or caffeinated beverages.</li>
<li>A history of amenorrhea ie absence of menstrual cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ayurvedic Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>A vata pacifying diet is recommended.
<ul>
<li>Grains like rice, wheat, oats, amaranth, and quinoa.</li>
<li>Vegetables such as carrots, peas, green beans, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens.</li>
<li>Fruits like pineapple, papaya, peaches, plums, grapes, mangoes, oranges, cherries, coconut, and figs.</li>
<li>Ghee and sesame oil (til tel).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Daily Abhyanga (self-massage) with sesame oil (til) is a must to keep the vata pacified and also to strengthen the bones.</li>
<li>Include herbs like ashwagandha, Triphala, and flaxseed (alsi ke beej) in your diet.</li>
<li>Spend time in the sun to ensure you get proper vitamin D.</li>
<li>Have a proper exercise regime to lose excess weight. However, if you have a tendency to over-exercise, reduce the amount of exercise as this too is a cause of Osteoporosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for long-term maintenance of the condition or to be free of it completely, you should consult a Jiva doctor. You can dial 0129-4040404 from your mobile phone or click on ‘Speak to a Doctor’ under the CONNECT tab in the Jiva Health App.</p>

<li>Constipation can cause a lot of pain and discomfort in children.</li>
<li>Stomach massages, warm baths, and gentle exercises can help relieve constipation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Babies get constipated due to a ton of reasons, such as the type of milk you give them and the introduction of solid foods. Even dehydration or giving them medicines that have the side effect of causing constipation could be responsible for their discomfort.</p>
<p>While it’s normal for babies to suffer from constipation, it causes them a great deal of pain. You can try these Ayurvedic tips and tricks to bring them some relief</p>
<p><strong>Stomach Massage:</strong> A gentle stomach massage does wonders to ease constipation. With light fingers massage the belly with coconut oil or sesame oil in small clockwork motions.</p>
<p><strong>Coconut Oil:</strong> Try applying coconut oil to the baby’s anus. This lubricates the area and eases any pain they may be experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>Baths:</strong> Bathing your baby in warm water with 1-2 tsp of baking soda in it is a great way of relaxing their anal muscles and also soothing any itching or pain that may be troubling them in that area.</p>
<p><strong>Gentle Exercise:</strong> Lay your baby on his/her back. Lift up the legs and gently move them in a manner similar to how one paddles a cycle. Don’t force the movement and do it slowly to loosen up the baby’s intestinal muscles. This exercise will get the bowels moving and help ease constipation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Children are overly fond of sweets, but if you indulge them, it could lead to complications.</li>
<li>Plaque, caused by bad oral hygiene, is one of the major cause of cavities.</li>
<li>Gum massage is an excellent way to ease swollen gums, toothache and bleeding gums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kids love candies, soft drinks, and sweets, but you as a parent know that such foods are terrible for their oral health. Tooth decay leads to cavities, which are incredibly painful.</p>
<h2>Here are some of the causes of tooth decay</h2>
<ul>
<li>A lot of sugary foods.</li>
<li>Not brushing properly.</li>
<li>Plaque, caused by bad oral hygiene, is also a cause of cavities.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The Ayurvedic Approach to Good Dental Health</strong></h2>
<h2>1. Chew on Neem Stems</h2>
<p>The antibacterial properties of neem make it an excellent way to combat tooth decay. Pick a small, soft, leafless stem and ask your kid to chew on the end.</p>
<h2>2. Oil pulling</h2>
<p>Long used in India to maintain good oral health, all you have to do is take some sunflower (surajmukhi), sesame (til), or coconut (nariyal) oil in your mouth and swish it in your mouth as if you were rinsing with it.</p>
<h2>3. Gum massage</h2>
<p>Combine 2 teaspoons of mustard oil with a ¼ teaspoon of salt and use this to gently massage your gums in a circular motion. This is an excellent way to ease swollen gums, toothache, and bleeding gums.</p>
<h2>4. Gargle with salt</h2>
<p>Simply gargling with a cup full of warm water that has half a spoon of salt dissolved in it will help you prevent tooth decay.</p>

<li>Vata balancing spiced chai is a delicious beverage to generate internal warmth and keep the agni, digestive fire, burning.</li>
<li>The pungency of spices like cardamom, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, tulsi, and turmeric helps remove ama.</li>
<li>It’s warm properties help counterbalance the cold weather outside</li>
</ul>
<p>Winters are the season of chilly breezes, snuggly blankets and piping hot beverages. During winters, the body is known to succumb to an increase of cold energy, i.e. vata aggravation. And as the season progresses, the changes in the environment can lead to seasonal and doshic imbalances. So, what’s the fix?</p>
<p>Ayurveda recommends a counterbalancing lifestyle approach. Therefore, in winters, battle the cold with warm drinks and food. And what’s better than Ayurvedic herbal teas to warm you up from within. Check out this fragrant, spiced tea to keep you warm and active this winter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add 6 cups of water in a pot and heat over medium-high.</li>
<li>Next, crush 6 Elaichis (cardamom pods) along with the seeds and put</li>
<li>Mix 1 cinnamon stick, I tsp. of grated ginger and ¼ tsp. of ajwain (carom seeds) with one tsp. of licorice powder.</li>
<li>Add the mixed spices to the boiling water and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat, and add ¾ tsp. of dried tulsi leaves.</li>
<li>Let the leaves steep for 3-5 min.</li>
<li>Add honey to taste, strain it and serve.</li>
</ul>
<p>This vata balancing spiced chai is a delicious beverage to generate internal warmth and keep the Agni, digestive fire burning. The pungency of spices like cardamom, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, tulsi, and turmeric helps remove ama (toxins), eases the stagnation and blockage that can stem from vata aggravation.</p>

<li>Herbal teas are great to beat the cold and give your body something warm and comforting.</li>
<li>Cardamom (elaichi) and cinnamon (dalchini) are excellent pitta pacifiers</li>
<li>Licorice (mulethi) and tulsi help eliminate ama from the body</li>
</ul>
<p>When the temperature drops, we crave for something warm and comforting. And that’s when we tend to splurge on drinks like hot chocolate or coffee. The question is, can you satisfy those cravings without consuming extra calories? Well, according to Ayurveda, you can. The ancient science of the Vedas recommends drinking Pitta-balancing spiced herbal teas to keep you hydrated, nourished and satiated.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick recipe of how to make a delicious and a healthy cupful of warm goodness you can enjoy in the winters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heat 6 cups of water on a medium flame.</li>
<li>While the water heats, crush 4 cardamom pods including the seeds.</li>
<li>Next, take the crushed cardamom, 1 cinnamon (dalchini) stick, ½ tsp. licorice (mulethi ) powder, ½ tsp. turmeric (haldi) powder and ¼ tsp. ginger powder. Add it all to the boiling water.</li>
<li>Let it simmer for 20-25 min so that only half the amount of liquid remains in the pot.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and add ½ tsp. of dried tulsi leaves.</li>
<li>Let the leaves steep for 5-10 min</li>
<li>Strain the tea in a cup, add a tsp. of honey, stir, and serve</li>
</ul>
<p>This tea is great for people with pitta constitutions. Cooling spices like cardamom and cinnamon are excellent pitta pacifiers. Licorice and tulsi help eliminate ama from the body. Begin with one cup a day and notice the difference.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winter chill in the air can only mean one thing &#8211; it’s time to indulge in warm, spiced teas! Ayurveda has recommended teas to soothe troubled minds, relieve tension, boost ojas (immunity) and balance the doshas. So here’s a mix of two types of teas to help you settle in during this frosty season.</p>
<h2>Recipe 1 – Helps relieve the symptoms of a cold</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take one cup of water and heat it in a pan.</li>
<li>Once the water starts to boil, add 1 brown cardamom (badi elaichi), crushed, 1 stick of licorice (mulethi) root and 1/3 tsp of mint (pudina) leaves.</li>
<li>Boil it for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Strain the herbs.</li>
<li>Once the tea cools down a little, add a tsp. of honey in it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recipe 2 – Helps ease the symptoms of congestion, mucus, infection or flu-like symptoms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heat one cup of water in a pan.</li>
<li>Bring the water to boil and add 1 stick of licorice root, I cinnamon stick and 1/3 tsp of tulsi leaves.</li>
<li>Boil it for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Strain the herbs.</li>
<li>Once the tea cools down a little, add a tsp. of honey in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try these teas during a chilly evening to warm up the body and soul and to get your prana (vital energy) flowing. The honey stokes the digestive fire and reduces indigestion. The licorice root is great for a sore throat and cold. As you can see, not only is this hot cuppa soothing and comforting, it’s also great for your health.</p>

<ul>
<li>Men value their strength and virility and that is getting impacted by the rigors of modern times</li>
<li>To fix this problem, men should have dates and ghee.</li>
<li>Dates are high in fibre and help balance vata.</li>
<li>Ghee boosts immunity, increases kapha and therefore, increasing ojas.</li>
</ul>
<p>To a man, his strength and virility are very important. However, with the way of life in the modern day, there are various factors like diet, stress, lack of exercise and more, that weaken your energy, strength and sex drive. To tackle this issue, Ayurveda recommends certain foods that balance your kapha.</p>
<p>There are various foods that promote virility, and dates and ghee have proven to be excellent in this regard. Dates are high in fibre and help balance vata while ghee is considered a superfood that boosts immunity, aids digestion, increases kapha and therefore, increasing ojas which helps in improving virility.</p>
<h2><strong>So, here is a recipe using dates and ghee to help you boost your energy levels and virility</strong></h2>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dates – 15</li>
<li>Ghee – 1 cup</li>
<li>Saffron (kesar) – a pinch</li>
<li>Cinnamon (dalchini) – a pinch</li>
<li>Cardamom (elaichi) – a pinch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a small pan, melt ghee.</li>
<li>Stir in the saffron, cinnamon and cardamom. Stir for 1-2 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
<li>Take a clean, dry jar and put the dates in.</li>
<li>Pour the ghee mixture in the jar when it’s lukewarm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have one date every morning, and you’ll notice a rise in your energy levels.</p>

<li>A balanced diet, exercise and abhyanga help keep ojas level normal.</li>
</ul>
