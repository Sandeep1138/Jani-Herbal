								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brain-stimulating and memory-enhancing Ayurvedic combinations have always enjoyed tremendous popularity all over the world. Their demand is skyrocketting in today&#8217;s competitive world. Memorica syrup has been designed to meet this requirement. Brahmi (Bacopa monnieri), Shankhpushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis) and Vacha (Acorus calamus) used in this syrup are well-known for their nerve stimulating activity, memory enhancing property and nervine tonic like features. Numerous modern researches have windigated these properties of them and offered more credibility to the Ayurvedic claims. Kushmand (Benincasa cerifera) used in Memorica syrup nourishes the brain cells and improves its functioning. Dhaniya (Coriandrum sativum) improves digestion and absorption from the gut and more importantly destroys worms which are often responsible for poor academic performance and unsatisfactory brain functioning among children.</p>
