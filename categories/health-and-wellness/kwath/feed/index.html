								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rasnasaptak kwath is excellent in treating various musculoskeletal and joint diseases. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lumbago, sciatica, spondylosis, general back ache respond well to this Ayurvedic preparation. While rasna, giloya and devdaroo are excellent analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, gokshur and punarnava are potent diuretics and therefore reduce swellings. Eranda and amaltaas are known to be good purgatives. They ignite gastric fire, digestion and eliminate toxins from the body and act against flatulence.</p>
