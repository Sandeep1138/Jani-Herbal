								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jiva Skin Tea is a handy addition to your home remedy kit for any skin problems that you may develop. It is a combination of ingredients that root out the cause of your skin maladies by going in far deeper than the skin. They cleanse the body systems and prevent the recurrence of skin conditions. Completely natural and picked from organic environs, its ingredients have given results for centuries. Moreover, they are balanced to remedy dosha vitiation in body systems preventing other diseases that may be in the making without your knowledge. Try it now and find out for yourself. It is totally free from side effects.</p>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Indication</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">All types of skin disorders and related complications.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane active ng-scope">
<h2>Action</h2>
<p class="ng-binding">Though all three doshas result in morbid skin conditions, the primary cause is the aggravation of pitta. These doshas cause the accumulation of &#8216;dooshivish&#8217; (specific poisons) that manifest in undesirable skin conditions. They also cause contamination of deeper tissues. So, mere local application will provide only temporary relief. The herbs in the tea not only achieve a symptomatic relief but also cleanse the ‘dooshi vish’ and decontaminate the deep tissues. There are ingredients that increase the circulation in the channels, which prevents the accumulation of these toxins again, providing a lasting remedy.</p>
